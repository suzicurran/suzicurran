# 👋 I'm Suzi Curran

I'm a creative and practical developer living in Boston, MA. I worked at Wayfair from 2017 to 2023 as a senior software engineer and built scalable, performant services to support a catalog of millions of products. You can [read](https://www.aboutwayfair.com/suzi-curran) more about my work.

I've recently returned from a 3-month sabbatical in Japan and am getting back into frontend work with a TypeScript project. 
You can :koko: [follow along](https://github.com/suzicurran/kanakomplete) as I build tools to manage my personal Japanese lexicon.

I also greatly enjoy open source development and professionally contributed to several C# projects now in enterprise use:
- :a: [AeroSharp](https://github.com/wayfair-incubator/AeroSharp), which provides features like serialization and compression on top of the .NET Aerospike client
- 🗣️ [Gossip](https://github.com/wayfair-incubator/Gossip), which adds to [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper)'s functionality for quick and easy queries on your relational DB of choice
- 📃 [WaySON](https://github.com/wayfair-incubator/WaySON), which extends the basic serialization/deserialization functionality of System.Text.Json with support for missing types

In addition, I also developed and maintain mod tooling for the 2022 indie game "I Was a Teenage Exocolonist":
- :package: [ExomodPackager](https://github.com/suzicurran/ExomodPackager), which packages .exo file changes as patches for distribution
- :rocket: [ExomodLoader](https://github.com/suzicurran/ExomodLoader), which handles for both game and mod version updates, mod conflicts, and more
