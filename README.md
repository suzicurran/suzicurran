# 👋 I'm Suzi Curran

> :warning: :airplane: I'm currently AFK on a 3-month long sabbatical trip across Japan. If you're interested in photos as much as PRs, see [Instagram](https://instagram.com/suzicurran).

I'm a creative and practical developer living in Boston, MA. Until Fall 2023, I was working with Wayfair as a senior software engineer and building highly scalable and performant services to support a catalog of millions of products. You can [read](https://www.aboutwayfair.com/suzi-curran) more about my work.

I greatly enjoy open source development and I maintain several C# projects in enterprise use:
- :a: [AeroSharp](https://github.com/wayfair-incubator/AeroSharp), which provides features like serialization and compression on top of the .NET Aerospike client
- 🗣️ [Gossip](https://github.com/wayfair-incubator/Gossip), which adds to [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper)'s functionality for quick and easy queries on your relational DB of choice
- 📃 [WaySON](https://github.com/wayfair-incubator/WaySON), which extends the basic serialization/deserialization functionality of System.Text.Json with support for missing types

In addition, I also developed and maintain mod tooling for the 2022 indie game "I Was a Teenage Exocolonist":
- :package: [ExomodPackager](https://github.com/suzicurran/ExomodPackager), which packages .exo file changes as patches for distribution
- :rocket: [ExomodLoader](https://github.com/suzicurran/ExomodLoader), which handles for both game and mod version updates, mod conflicts, and more
